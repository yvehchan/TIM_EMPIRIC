# Source files for the EMPIRIC RAW processing pipeline

The contect of this folder is an assortment of the Perl scripts and a C-program that "analyze-empiric.pl" relies on for processing.

### Random remarks:

- empiric-parse-v7.c is a C-code for the "./processfasta" program, the very initial step of the pipeline that does processing of the raw short read files in FASTQ format.
