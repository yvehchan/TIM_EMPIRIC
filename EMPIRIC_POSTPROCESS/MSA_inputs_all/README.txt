All multiple sequence alignments used in the paper are collected in the folder:

- MSA used for SCA analysis. "free" formatted MSA is used for analysis, while "fasta" is here for convenience. Originally stored in "TIM_EMPIRIC/EMPIRIC_POSTPROCESS/Ranganathan_SCA5/SCA5_forDist".

ncbi-nr-537-alignmen_cleaned.free
ncbi-nr-537-alignmen_cleaned.fasta

- MSA used for PCA of EMPIRIC fitness data. Alignment obtained from PFam. Originally stored in "TIM_EMPIRIC/EMPIRIC_POSTPROCESS/PFam".

PF00218_full-Aln_fixed.fasta

- Structural MSAs used for PCA of EMPIRIC firness data. Alignment obtained by SPalign using Ss,Tt and Tm IGPS sequences as a templates for pairwise alignments. Originally stored in "TIM_EMPIRIC/EMPIRIC_POSTPROCESS/SPalignResults".
