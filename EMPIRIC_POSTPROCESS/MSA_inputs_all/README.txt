All multiple sequence alignments used in the paper are saved in this folder:

- MSA used for SCA analysis. "free" formatted MSA were used for analysis along with the original "fasta" files. These files are also stored in "TIM_EMPIRIC/EMPIRIC_POSTPROCESS/Ranganathan_SCA5/SCA5_forDist".

ncbi-nr-537-alignmen_cleaned.free
ncbi-nr-537-alignmen_cleaned.fasta

- MSA used for PCA of EMPIRIC fitness data. This alignment was obtained from PFam. A copy is also stored in "TIM_EMPIRIC/EMPIRIC_POSTPROCESS/PFam".

PF00218_full-Aln_fixed.fasta

- Structural MSAs used for PCA of EMPIRIC fitness data. Alignment was created using SPalign software with Ss,Tt and Tm IGPS sequences as templates for pairwise alignments. These files are also stored in "TIM_EMPIRIC/EMPIRIC_POSTPROCESS/SPalignResults".
