# TIM_EMPIRIC

Assorted constellation of scripts and procedure for processing and analysis of the EMPIRIC experiment performed on three IGPS orthologs. 


The following is a list of the folders' descriptions:


- ./Ranganathan_SCA5 is a folder created by unpacking an archive of SCA v5.0 toolbox for MATLAB, as downloaded from http://systems.swmed.edu/rr_lab/sca.html .

Simply aquire a copy of SCA toolbox, place modified scripts/inputs into internal folder and run the analysis.


- ./Pymol is for structure analysis/visual (Yvonne description...)


- ./EMPIRIC_RAW contains initial steps of the EMPIRIC analysis pipeline. Raw short reads are used as an input and estimated fitness values are generated as a result.

- ./EMPIRIC_POSTPROCESS contains postprocessing steps of the EMPIRIC analysis pipeline. Fitness readouts are used as input along with various MSAs of IGPS/TIM family proteins. PCA analysis, various p-value estimates and other analyses performed.
