### Comparison of fitness landscapes for 3 orthologous TIM barrel proteins

Assorted constellation of scripts and procedures for processing and analysis of the EMPIRIC experiment performed on three IGPS orthologs. 


The following is a list of the folders' descriptions:

- ./EMPIRIC_RAW
    * Initial steps of the EMPIRIC analysis pipeline. 
	* Raw short reads are used as an input and estimated fitness values are generated as a result.

- ./EMPIRIC_POSTPROCESS 
    * Postprocessing steps of the EMPIRIC analysis pipeline. 
	* Fitness readouts are used as input along with various MSAs of IGPS/TIM family proteins for sequence and structure analyses.


- ./EMPIRIC_setup
	* Details of the experimental setup (EMPIRIC).
